My implementation of solutions to Advent of Code 2022 in golang

Exploring creating GUIs using golang and attempting to visualize the solution to each day. I'm using [Fyne](https://fyne.io/) since it seemed popular and functional enough.

I haven't put much effort into making the code nice, but it's fun to get the solution and a visualization!


To make this work on your machine, create a `puzzleInputs` folder inside of the `days` folder and create a `dayX.txt` for `X=[1,25]` (day1.txt, day2.txt, etc.) containing your puzzle inputs.
